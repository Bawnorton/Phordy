## Inspiration

This was inspired by the game Miegakure, which is a 4D puzzle game.

## What it does

This is a game where your goal is to reach the end of the level, collecting coins along the way by moving the player and changing your position in the 4th dimension.

## How we built it

We built this using Unity and C# as we felt that it was a good way to not only learn game development but also to produce a game without having to worry about a lot of the fundamentals of application development.

## Challenges we ran into

Initially, we tried to make the game a 2D platformer, not too dissimilar to Dead Cells, however, we found that cutting 2D slices of 3D objects is a lot more complicated than cutting 3D level surfaces out of 4D objects. This is due to the fact that 3D game objects are hollow, thus, rendering the inside is a lot more complicated than just shrinking/growing a 3D object.

We also found that building the levels in the 4th dimension is very difficult, as it is hard to visualize what the level will look like in 3D, purely as a limitation of the human brain.

Our inexperience with the Unity Engine prior to this Hackathon also contributed to its challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The game is playable, and we are proud of that. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to make a game in a relatively short amount of time despite the complexity of the game.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about game development, how to use Unity, and working with other people on larger scale projects.
